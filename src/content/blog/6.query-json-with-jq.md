### Why do we need a JSON Query Parser

We developers deal with JSON objects everyday no matter what side of the application you are working on. And the ability to quickly query a complex json structure is a valuable skill to have jq is a tool that helps you to do exactly that.

### What is Jq

jq is a lightweight command-line JSON processor. It's expression language is designed for transforming JSON data through a pipeline of filters. Each filter takes an input and produces an output.
Key Properties

![jq-filter-functions](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxpgwkurg/image/upload/v1735716711/blog/jq-ocre_rgxqry.png)

- **Immutable**: Input JSON is never modified; all operations produce new values
- **Functional**: Based on composable functions and filters
- **Stream-based**: Each filter processes takes the input stream and produces an output stream which then can be piped just like how unix pipes.
- **Zero-Based**: Array indexing starts at 0

### Basics Usage of Jq

```sh
jq-blog on  master [?] 
❯ jq 'keys' ./main.json             
[
  "appState",
  "elements",
  "files",
  "source",
  "type",
  "version"
]

jq-blog on  master [?] 
❯ jq '.type' ./main.json                                                                                 
"excalidraw"

jq-blog on  master [?] 
❯ jq '.version' ./main.json
2

```

We start with the basic one to list all the keys of json use key
```
jq 'keys' ./.json
```

keys will retrieve the list of keys of the json file, to filter only one specific key you can use .{key_name}. Jq syntax is flexible and immutable as each function returns a object that can be manipulated in upcoming function Example 



### Arrays

```json
[
  {
    "one": 1
  },
  {
    "two": 2
  },
  {
    "three": 3
  },
  {
    "four": 4
  },
  {
    "five": 5
  },
  {
    "six": 6
  },
  {
    "seven": 7
  }
]
```

finding

| command  | example | output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first | `jq 'first` | { one: 1} |
| last  | `jq 'last'` | { seven: 7 } |
| nth | `jq 'nth(4)` | { five: 5 } |
| sub-array | `jq .[1:2]` | [{ one: 1}] |
| by Index | `jq .[3]` | { "four": 4} |



#### Array Transformations

Jq transformations are very useful when you want to manipulate arrays.
```sh
echo '[1, 2, 2, 3]' | jq '[.[] | . * 2] | unique'
# Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

Here is a `Typescript` equivalent of `jq` code

```tsx
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2];
const b = [...a].map((e) => e * 2); // [.[] | . *2]
const c = b.reduce((values: number[], acc) => { // | unique
  if (!values.includes(acc)) {
    values.push(acc);
  }
  return values;
}, []);
```

- Maps each array element (`.[] | . * 2`).
- Collects results into an array (`[...]`).
- Filters unique values (`unique`).



### Bonus tips

If you are using `jq` then you might want to use `jnv` which is a rust wrapper for `jq` which helps you to run `jq` command interactively. No Need to start from scratch again and again. [Check it out](https://github.com/ynqa/jnv).

If you are using `warp` and using a same jq query in multiple places then you might want to use `warp-workflow`. which is a easiest way to changer particular argument without typing the whole command again and again.
