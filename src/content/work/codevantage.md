### Bullet
Bullet is a platform that help users to create beautiful websites while keeping the contents in notion. My contributions included:

1. Built and maintained the frontend configuration system, enabling users to save custom settings (including membership controls and a CSS editor) to Firestore, with a focus on performance and code optimization.

2. Contributed to the site generation system that transforms Notion data into static websites; added support for newly introduced Notion features and resolved rendering-related bugs.

3. Developed reusable templates and worked on multiple client projects, ensuring reliable delivery and seamless platform integration.


### MindMap
MindMap is a tool that visualizes Notion pages as mind maps. My contributions included working on APIs and rendering pages as interactive cards. Despite working under tight deadlines, the project was a success and taught me how to thrive in high-pressure situations.

### Zero to Aha
Zero to Aha is a gamified onboarding checklist that’s still in development. My role focused on the front end, where I:

1. Built user interfaces to track progress and match conditions.
2. Developed a widget to monitor events using a mutation observer.
This experience helped me better understand state management in complex applications and how to handle intricate user interactions effectively.

## Reflections
Working on these projects gave me a profound appreciation for tools like Notion and Excalidraw, which have now become part of my daily workflow. While I was familiar with them before joining, working on real-world applications allowed me to dive deeper into their complexities.

With Notion, I explored its intricate API interactions, learned how it handles advanced features like dynamic data updates, and uncovered how its local SQLite setup supports seamless functionality. This experience reshaped how I think about building efficient and scalable systems.

Excalidraw, on the other hand, exposed me to the challenges of managing large-scale, complex codebases. Understanding how such a robust tool maintains its performance and modularity has significantly improved my coding and architectural skills. These hands-on experiences have not only made me more confident with these tools but also helped me develop a better approach to tackling complex systems in general.

I had the chance to collaborate closely with experienced leaders, observing how they approached complex challenges and made thoughtful decisions. This taught me valuable lessons about problem-solving, teamwork, and value other opinions. I’ve been fortunate to work with a really supportive and talented team, which made the experience even more rewarding.
