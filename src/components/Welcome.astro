        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            I am a <strong>Full stack developer</strong> deeply immersed in web technologies, and my
            coding journey began amidst the COVID lockdown in <code>2020</code>. Starting with <strong
                >Python</strong
            >, I later ventured into web technologies during my second year of college. However, it
            was my fascination with <strong>Operating Systems</strong> and <strong
                >Cloud Computing</strong
            > that truly intrigued me, revealing the intricacies of deploying and maintaining apps at
            scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a solid understanding of programming languages like <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong
                >Python</strong
            >, and <strong>C++</strong>, my programming skills and proficiency in data structures
            and algorithms have helped me tackle over <code>450 LeetCode problems</code>. This
            experience has provided me with diverse perspectives and refined my problem-solving
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            started using Linux in January <code>2022</code>; Itâ€™s almost <code>2.5 years</code> into
            that and I enjoyed everything about Linux. I began with vim and moved to neovim, and my <a
                href="https://github.com/Lakshmanshankar/dotfiles">dotfiles</a
            > repository had grown a lot since then. I love the awesome command line tools which make
            my developer workflow a breeze to work with. And I love <strong
                >dark color schemes with gradient texts</strong
            >; you can see them in all my works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, Iâ€™m focused on enhancing my skills in <strong>web technologies</strong> and deepening
            my understanding of data structures. For further details, hereâ€™s a link to my <a
