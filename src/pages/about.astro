                I started coding during the 2020 lockdown, first with Python and later moving into
                web development. Switching to Linux in 2022 shaped a lot of my workflow and
                interests — customizing my setup, building dotfiles, and falling in love with dark
                themes and gradient-heavy aesthetics.
            </p>

                Over the time at Codevantage, I've worked on a variety of projects, including
                <strong>Bullet</strong>, a platform that helps users create beautiful websites while
                keeping the contents in Notion. I also contributed to <strong>MindMap</strong>, a
                tool that visualizes Notion pages as mind maps.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this phase, I discovered a deep interest in rich text editors. That
                exploration led me to contribute to <strong>Lexical</strong> and eventually build my
                own editor,
                <strong>Formless</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at
                <a href="https://bounteous.com/">Bounteous</a>, where I work on the frontend of a
                large-scale analytics platform.
            </p>
            <p>Apart from programming, I enjoy cycling — especially on the weekends.</p>
            <p>
                I maintain a list of tools I use regularly for development.
