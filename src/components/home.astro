            I am a Full Stack Developer with over 1.4 years of experience. I am currently working at
            Bullet.so, a website builder that uses Notion as a CMS.

        <ul>
            <li>
                I am passionate about web technologies, database systems, and computer science in
                general.
            </li>
            <li>
                Currently, I am learning about serverless computing, edge computing, and advanced
                database systems. I recently published a blog about database connection management
                in serverless environmentsâ€”you can read it <a
                    href="/blog/database-connection-for-serverless">here</a
                >.
            </li>
            <li>
                I am a Software Developer from Coimbatore and open to exploring opportunities in the
                future.
