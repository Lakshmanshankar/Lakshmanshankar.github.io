In this article we dive deep into the `Jq` command. Which is a command line tool that let's you to query complex json structures and provide set of utility function to transform those JSON structures into new ones. 

### Why do we need a JSON Query Parser

We developers deal with JSON objects everyday no matter what side of the application you are working on. The ability to quickly find a thing on a relatively familiar yet complex structure is a valuable skill to have.  

### Basics Usage of Jq

```sh
jq-blog on  master [?] 
❯ jq 'keys' ./main.json             
[
  "appState",
  "elements",
  "files",
  "source",
  "type",
  "version"
]

jq-blog on  master [?] 
❯ jq '.type' ./main.json

```

We start with the basic one to list all the keys of json use key
```
jq 'keys' ./.json
```

keys will retrieve the list of keys of the json file, to filter only one specific key you can use .{key_name}. Jq syntax is flexible and immutable as each function returns a object that can be manipulated in upcoming function Example
